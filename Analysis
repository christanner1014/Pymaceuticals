Analysis:
Based on our findings in this data set, its clear that Ramicane and Capomulin was the most efective drug in reducing the size of the tumors in mice. 
This is highighted below especially in the box and whisker plot where they have significantly reduced tumor sizes as compared to the other drugs. 
I think what also gives us a better basis on this conclusion is that it also had the most amount of mice tested. The sample size of these two were the largest. 
This would negate any refutation saying that there was not enought testing done. 
In drug data, this is one of the most crucial elements in giving an unbiased and reasonable conclusion.
You can also see that with a .84 correlation, that as the weight of the mouse goes up, so does the size of the tumor. 
Another element which is important to note is that there was only one outlier. 
This gives us the ability to see that each drug had very similar effects to their subjects across the board.
The more outliers, the more inaccurate our estimates and conclusions would be.
